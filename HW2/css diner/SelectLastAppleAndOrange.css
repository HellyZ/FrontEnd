/* Last of Type Selector
Select the last element of a specific type
:last-of-type
Selects each last element of that type within another element. Remember type refers the kind of tag, so <p> and <span> are different types. 

I wonder if this is how the last dinosaur was selected before it went extinct.
Examples
div:last-of-type selects the last <div> in every element.
p span:last-of-type selects the last <span> in every <p>. */

orange:last-of-type, apple:last-of-type {
  /* Styles would go here. */
